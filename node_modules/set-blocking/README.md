set blocking `stdio` and `stderr` ensuring that terminal output does not truncate.

```js
const setBlocking = require('set-blocking')
setBlocking(true)
console.log(someLargeStringToOutput)
```

## Historical Context/Word of Warning

This was created as a shim to address the bug discussed in [node #6456](https:.com/nodejs/node/issues/6456). This bug crops up on
newer versions of Node.js (`0.12+`), truncating terminal output.

You should be mindful of the side-effects caused by using `set-blocking`:

* if your module sets blocking to `true`, it will effect other modules
  consuming your library. In [yargs](https:.com/yargs/yargs/blob/master/yargs.js#L653) we only call
  `setBlocking(true)` once we already know we are about to call `process.exit(code)`.
* this patch will not apply to subprocesses spawned with `isTTY = true`, this is
  the [default `spawn()` behavior](https:.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options).
