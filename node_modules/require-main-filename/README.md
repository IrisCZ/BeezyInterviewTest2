`require.main.filename` is great for figuring out the entry
point for the current application. This can be combined with a module like
[pkg-conf](https:.npmjs.com/package/pkg-conf) to, _as if by magic_, load
top-level configuration.

Unfortunately, `require.main.filename` sometimes fails when an application is
executed with an alternative process manager, e.g., [iisnode](https:.com/tjanczuk/iisnode).

`require-main-filename` is a shim that addresses this problem.

## Usage

```js
var main = require('require-main-filename')()
.main.filename.
```
